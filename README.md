# MyCheatsheets

This is a repo where I keep all my custom-made cheatsheets in raw code or plain text. These include many of the different software tools I have used, and aim to lock-in procedures that I would otherwise forget about.

I update them regularly as I add new tasks that I believe are useful to have written down. Use at your own risk/benefit. This user does not take responsibility for any bugs that these cheatsheets may originate.
